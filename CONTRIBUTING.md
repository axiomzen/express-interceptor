# Contributing

We love pull requests from everyone, and this is the place to go in order to publish one of those pull requests :)

* Fork, then clone the repo:

    	git clone git@github.com:your-username/express-interceptor.git

* Install dependencies:

    	npm install

* Make sure the tests pass:

    	npm test

* Push to your fork and [submit a pull request](https://github.com/axiomzen/express-interceptor/compare/).

At this point you're waiting on us. We like to at least comment on pull requests
within three business days (and, typically, one business day). We may suggest
some changes or improvements or alternatives.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Write [tests](https://github.com/axiomzen/express-interceptor/tree/master/tests).
* In case you are changing core features you should add [examples](https://github.com/axiomzen/express-interceptor/tree/master/examples).
